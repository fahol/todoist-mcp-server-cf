# Todoist MCP Server for Cloudflare

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com) that provides complete CRUD operations across all major Todoist entities. This server uses OAuth-based authorization and is deployed on Cloudflare Workers for high availability and global performance.

This is a fork and an extension from a proof of concept remote MCP server
implemented by deepakjois (https://github.com/deepakjois/todoist-mcp-server-cf).  Originally had only two basic tools.

Mainly a 1-1 translation of the Todoist API. May be upgraded to have it more
adequate for AI assistants or agents as MCP clients (i.e., fuse multiple API calls instead of calling them individually).
The current functionality relies on the model's capability to associate objects using keys.

This remote server has been tested using Claude's "custom integration" feature.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deploy Your Own Instance

For maximum security and control, deploy your own instance:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Cloudflare Account**: With Workers plan
2. **Todoist Developer App**: Create at [Todoist App Console](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html)
   - OAuth redirect URL: `https://<your-worker-url>/callback`

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo>
   cd todoist-mcp-server-cf
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets**:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put TODOIST_CLIENT_ID
   wrangler secret put TODOIST_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
   Wrangler will ask you to create a new worker if necessary

3. **Update Configuration**:
   - Copy `wrangler.jsonc.example` to `wrangler.jsonc`
   - Edit `wrangler.jsonc` as a local configuration
   - Update KV namespace ID to your own
   - Modify worker name and route as needed

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

5. **Verify**: Visit your worker URL to complete OAuth setup

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **OAuth 2.0**: Industry-standard secure authentication
- **Token Encryption**: Access tokens encrypted in Cloudflare KV storage
- **No Data Storage**: Only authorization tokens stored, no Todoist data cached
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy your own instance for complete control
